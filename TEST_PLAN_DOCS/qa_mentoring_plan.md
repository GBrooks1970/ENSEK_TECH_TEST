# Mentoring Plan: Manual QA to Mid-Level Test Automation QA

## Goal

Support Manual QA Engineers transitioning to proficient Test Automation Engineers with strong understanding of BDD and the Screenplay Pattern.

## Plan Overview

- **Stage 1: Foundations**

  - Introduce Agile, BDD, and Test Pyramid concepts
  - Hands-on with Gherkin syntax and writing user stories
  - Set up environment (e.g., SpecFlow/Cypress/Playwright)

- **Stage 2: Test Automation Basics**

  - Teach writing basic automated tests (UI & API)
  - Explain benefits of BDD principles in Test Automation
  - Introduction to assertions and reporting
  - Git basics and version control workflows

- **Stage 3: Screenplay Pattern Deep Dive**

  - Explain core concepts: Stage, Actor, Tasks, Questions
  - Build simple test flows using Screenplay structure
  - Compare with Page Object Pattern to highlight benefits

- **Stage 4: Real Project Integration**

  - Migrate existing manual tests into BDD/Gherkin format ready for possible automated tests
  - Use Tasks and Questions to structure reusable logic
  - Introduce CI integration with test runs

## Success Metrics

- ✅ **Knowledge Checks** after each phase (e.g., informal quizzes, code reviews)
- ✅ **Code Contributions** to shared automation repo / Skeleton project
- ✅ **Test Ownership**: Individuals lead writing of 2–3 Features/User Stories/Scenarios
- ✅ **Peer Demos**: Present screenplay implementation to peers / Contribute to pattern implementation iteration
- ✅ **Mentor Review**: Monthly assessment based on progress 1:1 chats
- ✅ **Confidence Surveys**: Self-assessed skill levels over time (~Monthly)

## Outcome

- Confident in building BDD-style automation using the Screenplay Pattern
- Able to contribute to CI pipelines and test architecture discussions
- Effective in writing reusable, maintainable test code that follows the project established design patterns
