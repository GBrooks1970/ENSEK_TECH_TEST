# ENSEK Technical Test

This repository contains automated test suites for ENSEK's Buy Energy feature, including API and UI tests using SpecFlow, Selenium WebDriver, and the Screenplay pattern.

## Scope

- The test suites cover the Buy Energy feature via both API and UI automation.
- **Database access is not provided**, enabling this would allow potential future expansion to include integration or data validation tests.
- **No formal acceptance criteria or requirements were provided**; therefore, assumptions were made regarding expected behaviors, workflows, and validation points based on available swagger docs and system exploration.

## Projects

- **API_TEST/**: BDD API tests for ENSEK's backend endpoints.
- **UI_TEST/**: UI automation tests for the Buy Energy feature, following the Screenplay pattern.
- **POSTMAN/**: Postman collections and environments for manual and automated API testing.
- **TEST_BUG_REPORT/**: Area for reporting and tracking test-related bugs.

See each project's `README.md` for setup and usage instructions.
